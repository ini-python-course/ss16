# Structure

The course runs from 21.9. until 2.10., presumably from 10:00 to 18:00 every day.

The first week is intended to focus on Python and important concepts and techniques, the second week is reserved for your own projects.

While the final grading of the course depends on your final projects (not your attendence in the course), we strongly believe that you and your project can profit a lot from a setting where you can receive feedback from us or other students (in contrast to you working alone at home). We therefore plan to have different sessions where you can present and share your ideas, progress, problems, and results with the whole course.

By the way, we are: [Bj√∂rn](http://www.ini.rub.de/users/bjorn-weghenkel), [Fabian](http://www.ini.rub.de/users/fabian-schonfeld), [Jan](http://www.ini.rub.de/users/jan-melchior), [Stefan](http://www.ini.rub.de/users/stefan-richthofer), and [Varun](http://www.ini.rub.de/users/varun-kompella).

# Concept

The concept of the course is likely a bit different from other courses or lectures. So it might be worth elaborating a bit:

* **Assisted self-learning -** First of all, we want to minimize the classic teacher-centered approach. Programming is a very practical thing and hearing us talk for hours what you *could* do with Python is likely boring. Also, all of you are smart computer science students who learned about other programming languages before. Learning Python (at least the basics) should be easy now, you don't need us for that. What we can offer though is years of experience. So while you learn Python the way that suits you most, we can assist with background knowledge and best-practices.

* **Responsibility for the outcome -** We assume that you have (or can develop) a pretty good sense of what kind of learning/teaching works best for you and what doesn't. And also about what motivates you to learn a new language and what doesn't. Our goal is to create a course that is interesting and suits your preferences. This however places a lot of responsibility for the outcome on your side. If some aspect of the course doesn't make sense to you or if you need something else to learn, tell us! The same when you feel bored or overchallenged. Or if you are not comfortable with the course for some reason. To adjust the course, we need to know about these things.

* **Reducing evaluation during the course -** Teaching at a university always inlcudes the inherent conflict of creating an environment for optimal learning on the one hand and the necessity of giving grades on the other. A good environment for learning often is a playful one where a lot of things could be tried without fearing errors and where it is okay to ask a lot of stupid questions. This atmosphere get's easily disturbed by the fact that many of you need a grade in the end and we are the ones who need to come up with one. We try to reduce this conflict keeping evaluations out of the course itself. Only what you hand in at the end will count.

Speaking about evaluation...

# Evaluation

## Grading

Many of you will need an individual grading in the end for your studies. For this grading, your project will be considered with respect to the following factors:

* **Correctness -** Code works / doesn't work
* **Documentation -** Helpfull / not or badly documented
* **Usability -** Easy to use / unnecessarily complicated
* **Efficiency -** Performant / unnecessarily slow

All of the above with respect to the difficulty of the project.

While personal projects may be a nice way to learn a language, it complicates the process of grading for at least two reasons: First, gradings have to be personalized even though you may (and are encouraged to) work in groups. Second, the emphasis of this course is on scientific computing while your projects may or may not be scientific at all. This is why we are going to sit together with each of you for a few minutes the last day and talk with you about what you have learned during the course. As an orientation, having a thorough understanding of the content of the notebooks will correspond to a very good grading.

## EvaSys

In the end of the course we will also ask you to (anonymously) fill out the evaluation sheets from the university. This will help us to further improve the course for future participants.

# Have fun! :)
